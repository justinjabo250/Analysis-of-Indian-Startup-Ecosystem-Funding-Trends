# Project Description

This project aims to inform significant players who are thinking about joining the Indian startup ecosystem. To do this, we will look at significant indicators of startup investment in India from 2018 to 2021. Utilizing this knowledge, management will make smart business decisions.

I developed a hypothesis to test the dataset in order to get a reliable result. The data were studied in terms of technological and non-technology industries in order to establish which industry is more likely to draw investment from investors.

    <li>what are the top five sectors where funding is maximum?</li>
    <li>what is the location with most starstup funded?</li>
    <li>what is the maximum amount of funding recieved by a startup?</li>
    <li>what is the most startups which has a potential or can attract more investor's to invest in?</li>
    <li>what is the total amount of funds each year?</li>
    <li>In which year did a startup recieve the highest amount of funding?</li>
    <li>Which stage receives more investment from investors for start-ups?</li>
    <li>Who makes the biggest investments among investors?</li>
    <li>Can the startup's age effect the amount of funding it receives from investors?</li>

# Hypothesis :


I created the null and alternate hypotheses to concentrate on two groups: companies that are technology-biased and startups that are not technology-biased, in order to further evaluate and analyze the data. Hence, the following two hypotheses are presented:

To focus on two groups‚Äîstartups that are not technology-biased and companies that are‚Äîand to further examine and analyze the data, I developed the null and alternate hypotheses. Consequently, the two following hypotheses are offered:


**NULL:** It is unlikely that Indian startups in the technology industries will get funded.


**ALTERNATE:** Indian startups in the technology industries are likely to receive investment.


# üìÅ Dataset

Public dataset can be found [`here`](https://github.com/ikoghoemmanuell/Indian-Startup-Funding-Analysis-Group-Nice/blob/main/India%20Startup%20Funding.zip)

# üöÄ Setup

Install the required packages to be able to run the evaluation locally.

You need to have [`Python3`](https://www.python.org/) on your system. Then you can clone this repo and being at the repo's root (`root :: repo_name> ...`) follow the steps below:

- Windows:

```python
python -m venv venv; venv\Scripts\activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt
```

- Linux & MacOs:

```python
python3 -m venv venv; source venv/bin/activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt
```

The both long command-lines have a same structure, they pipe multiple commands using the symbol **;** but you may manually execute them one after another.

1. **Create the Python's virtual environment** that isolates the required libraries of the project to avoid conflicts;
2. **Activate the Python's virtual environment** so that the Python kernel & libraries will be those of the isolated environment;
3. **Upgrade Pip, the installed libraries/packages manager** to have the up-to-date version that will work correctly;
4. **Install the required libraries/packages** listed in the `requirements.txt` file so that it will be allow to import them into the python's scripts and notebooks without any issue.

**NB:** For MacOs users, please install `Xcode` if you have an issue.
