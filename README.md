## Introduction

Ideas, creativity, and execution are essential for a start-up to flourish. But are they enough? Investors provide start-ups and other entrepreneurial ventures with the capital---popularly known as "funding"---to think big, grow rich, and leave a lasting impact.¬†
In this project, I am going to analyse funding received by start-ups in India from 2018 to 2021.

## Scenario

Azubi Africa is trying to venture into the Indian start-up ecosystem. As the data experts of the company, team nice is to investigate the ecosystem and propose the best course of action.

# üìÅ Dataset

Public dataset can be found [`here`](https://github.com/ikoghoemmanuell/Indian-Startup-Funding-Analysis-Group-Nice/blob/main/India%20Startup%20Funding.zip)

# üöÄ Setup

Install the required packages to be able to run the evaluation locally.

You need to have [`Python3`](https://www.python.org/) on your system. Then you can clone this repo and being at the repo's root (`root :: repo_name> ...`) follow the steps below:

- Windows:

```python
python -m venv venv; venv\Scripts\activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt
```

- Linux & MacOs:

```python
python3 -m venv venv; source venv/bin/activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt
```

The both long command-lines have a same structure, they pipe multiple commands using the symbol **;** but you may manually execute them one after another.

1. **Create the Python's virtual environment** that isolates the required libraries of the project to avoid conflicts;
2. **Activate the Python's virtual environment** so that the Python kernel & libraries will be those of the isolated environment;
3. **Upgrade Pip, the installed libraries/packages manager** to have the up-to-date version that will work correctly;
4. **Install the required libraries/packages** listed in the `requirements.txt` file so that it will be allow to import them into the python's scripts and notebooks without any issue.

**NB:** For MacOs users, please install `Xcode` if you have an issue.
